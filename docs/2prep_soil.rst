Soil
****

General guidelines for preparing soil samples :ref:`for DNA extraction <DNAex_soil>`.

1. After collection (or if soil samples are frozen), transfer soil into a clean paper 
   bag and active thaw/dry the samples in an oven at ~37ºC.

2. When the soil is dry, then homogenise the soil sample by 
   for example transferring soil to a sterile zip-lock plastic bag that is **reinforced**
   with the tape on the sides and crush the soil in between the hands into fine 
   soil powder.

3. Weigh maximum of **250 mg** (~100 mg for very organic rich sample) of the soil powder to a 2 mL
   PowerBead Pro Tube. Store the PowerBead Pro tubes with the soil at
   -20ºC until further steps. Or proceed immediately with the DNA extraction.

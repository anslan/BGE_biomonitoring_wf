General guidelines for sampling soil for identifying soil microbial communities via metabarcoding following `Tedersoo et al. 2022 <https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.16460>`_.

Sampling equipment
------------------

| **Minimal required equipment**: 

| 1. Lab gloves
| 2. Soil corer, or knife, or gardening shovel
| 3. Zip-lock bags 

General considerations
----------------------

**Sample size.** Individual soil samples should be sufficiently large to ensure 
there is enough material for DNA extraction, required physicochemical analysis, and for storage/backup. 
**Spatial scale.** In order to maintain statistical independence of samples at a site, 
samples should be positioned beyond the spatial autocorrelation range, usually 5-10 meters in soil fungi. 
**Pooling samples.** The amount of subsamples can significantly impact the representation of microbial diversity in heterogeneous environments; 
using fewer subsamples may lead to an underestimated diversity. 
The optimal number of subsamples to combine varies depending on the area size, 
typically ranging from 7 to 25. 


The pooling effect is probably influenced by the diversity of habitats, such as pH levels, organic material, salinity, and types of plant species existing.
Given the greater overall richness, pooled samples also require deeper
sequencing to detect rare taxa.
Furthermore, pooling is unsuited for co-occurrence
analyses assessing biotic interactions

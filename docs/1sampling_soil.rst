Soil
*****

General guidelines (following `Tedersoo et al. 2022 <https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.16460>`_) for sampling soil for identifying soil microbial communities via metabarcoding.

____________________________________________________

Sampling equipment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| **Minimal required equipment**: 

| 1. Disposable lab gloves
| 2. Soil corer, or knife, or gardening shovel
| 3. Clean zip-lock bags or screw-cap vessels

____________________________________________________

General considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Sample size.** Individual soil samples should be sufficiently large to ensure 
there is enough material for DNA extraction, required physicochemical analysis, and for storage/backup. 

**Spatial scale.** In order to maintain statistical independence of samples at a site, 
samples should be positioned beyond the spatial autocorrelation range, usually 5-10 meters in soil fungi. 

**Pooling samples.** The amount of subsamples can significantly impact the representation of microbial diversity in heterogeneous environments; 
using fewer subsamples may lead to an underestimated diversity. 
The optimal number of subsamples to combine varies depending on the area size, 
typically ranging from 7 to 25. 


The pooling effect is influenced by the diversity of habitats, such as pH levels, organic material, salinity, and types of plant species existing.
Given the greater overall richness, pooled samples also require deeper
sequencing to detect rare taxa. 
**However, pooling is unsuited for co-occurrence analyses** assessing biotic interactions.

Sampling
~~~~~~~~

* Sample during **dry weather** to avoid contamination by water from rain and wet gloves. 
* Wear **disposable gloves** during sampling to avoid contaminating samples with skin or foreign microbiota.
* **Sterilize sampling tools** to avoid cross-contamination between independent samples. 
  Sterilization should be done with with oxidizing agents (e.g., bleach) or flame, and wiping with EtOH. 
  **Sterilization should not be done only with EtOH** as the latter do not denature DNA. 
* Place samples into clean zip-lock bags or screw-cap vessels. 
* To remove site or sampling material contaminants a posteriori, include **field controls** (e.g., empty tubes left opened at the site or extraction of sample storage buffer).

After sampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Maintain the samples at cold temperature during (long) transport to limit biological activity within samples.

* When possible, the best option is to either extract DNA right after sampling or to **rapidly freeze** the collected materials in liquid nitrogen and maintain them at -80Â°C.
  **Pooled subsamples must be well mixed before freezing**, as it is later difficult to homogenize frozen material.
  When freezing, it is important to **avoid multple melt-thaw cycles**, which may lead to significant changes in the detected communities.

* **Rapid drying** methods such as freeze drying and cabinet drying are good alternatives to freezing. 
  Drying with silica gel is a viable option for few grams of soil. 
  Dried samples can be kept for long time (decades) if kept air-tight in the dark and at constant temperature (room temperature).

* Prior to DNA extraction, it is important to homogenize the soil sample.
